Description:

SageLife is an overhaul of my original Conway's Game of Life clone. I felt as if the original was extremely clunky
and the controls were pretty unresponsive. This version will have a better look and feel, as well as added features.

Planned Features:
- Support for premade patterns will be added. Possible importing from files.
- Configurable settings, including custom rules (the conditions cells evolve from), etc...
- A better graphical appearance.
- Smoother controls. Will add ability to drag mouse cursor to add multiple cells at a time,
  rather than clicking each box individually.
  
Known Issues:
- None
